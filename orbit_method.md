We are trying to learn about application of geometric 
quantisation in representation theory, in particular, 
what's called *Kirillov's orbit method*. 

The main reference will be [Askay Venkatesh's lectures](https://www.mit.edu/~fengt/249C_2017.pdf) on this, with notes taken by Tony Feng and Niccolo Ronchetti. 
We will put comments on this notes as we're learning the subject, and 
the edited notes is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7shsi2bys16v25b/Venkatesh_GeometricQuantization_Rep%20Theory.pdf?dl=0) (updated 24/05/2022).

## Schedule 

Here is the zoom ID 872 3002 3928 with password 135105.

Talk 1 (Toan, 15/03/2022): Overview, describe irreducible 
representations and characters of $\text{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$.
[Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/Kirrilov_orbit_method/20220315_Orbit_method.pdf). 

Talk 2 (Jaco 23/03/2022):

on the spheres (section 1.3 of Venkatesh's notes).

$\text{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$.

Talk 5 (Jaco 22/04/2022):
Introduce pseudo-differential operators. Sections 3.1-3.3 of  Venkatesh's lectures. 
[Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/Kirrilov_orbit_method/20220422_Jaco_orbitMethod_talk5.pdf).

Talk 6 (Toan 26/04/2022):
Discuss geometric decomposition of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ using pseudo-differential operators.

lectures.

Talk 7 (Jaco 06/05/2022): Describe $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ as a unitary 
representation of the Heisenberg group. Prove Schur's lemma for unitary representations. 
Sections 4.3, 4.4 of Venkatesh's lectures. 
[Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/Kirrilov_orbit_method/20220505_orbit_method_talk7.pdf).

Talk 8 (Toan 24/05/2022): Describe a character formula for the representation of the 
Heisenberg group on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 of Venkatesh's lectures. 
[Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/Kirrilov_orbit_method/20220524_orbit_method_talk8.pdf).

Talk 9 (Jaco 09/06/2022): Describe the coadjoint orbits of the Heisenberg group. Rewrite
the character formula for the representation of the Heisenberg group on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ 
in the sense of Kirrilov character formula. Sections 4.8, 4.9 of Venkatesh's lectures.
