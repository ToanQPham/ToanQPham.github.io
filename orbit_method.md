We are trying to learn about application of geometric 
quantisation in representation theory, in particular, 
what's called *Kirillov's orbit method*. 

The main reference will be [Askay Venkatesh's lectures](https://www.mit.edu/~fengt/249C_2017.pdf) on this.
We will put comments on this notes as we're learning the subject, and 
the edited notes is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7shsi2bys16v25b/Venkatesh_GeometricQuantization_Rep%20Theory.pdf?dl=0)

## Schedule 

Here is the zoom ID 872 3002 3928 with password 135105.

Talk 1 (Toan, 15/03/2022): Overview, describe irreducible 
representations and characters of $\text{SO}_2(\mathbb{R})$.

Talk 2 (Jaco 22/03/2022): ...

## Resourses

Other than the main reference above, here are some more. 

### About geometric quantisation

[Geometric quantisation's seminar by Heidelberg University](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~jbimmermann/geometricquantization) with [a detailed list of topics](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~jbimmermann/geo.pdf). 

[Nice and short overview on geometric quantisation by Baykara](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2019/REUPapers/Baykara.pdf)

### About orbit's method

Kirrilov's book Lectures on the Orbit Method, 
with a [review](https://klein.mit.edu/~dav/kirillov.pdf) by David Vogan.
