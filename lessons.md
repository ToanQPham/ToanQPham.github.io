Some of the great lessons/quotes that I learnt and want to 
write it here in case I forgot. 

*There are two ways to do mathematics. The first is to be smarter than everybody else. The second way is to be stupider than everybody else - but persistent.* - based on a quotation from Raoul Bott.

*Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen.*
David Hilbert

(We must know. We shall know.)

*There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave.*

(I found various sourses for this but I saw this quote the first time when I read about Paul Erdős)

*Finally, if you attempt to read this without working through a significant number of exercises (see §0.0.1), I will come to your house and pummel you with
[Gr-EGA] until you beg for mercy. It is important to not just have a vague sense of
what is true, but to be able to actually get your hands dirty. To quote Mark Kisin:
“You can wave your hands all you want, but it still won’t make you fly.”*
