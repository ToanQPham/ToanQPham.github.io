## Questions

Relation between Bruhat decomposition and Weyl groups?

What is group of Lie type?

What is difference between Bourbaki's and Dynkin's
convention of Dynkin's diagram. 


## Notations for root systems

$V$ real vector space, $V_0$ space spanned by root systems

$\Phi$ root system

$r_{\alpha}$ reflection

$\sum$ simple roots $r_{\alpha}$, 

$s_{\alpha}$ simple relflection, 

$W$ Weyl group

$\mathcal{C}_+$ positive (closed) Weyl chamber,
$\mathcal{C}_+^{\circ}$ open Weyl chamber. 

$W(y)$ stabilizer of $y\in V$

## Root systems in algebraic groups

$X^*(T)\cong \mathbb{Z}^{r+1}$ rational characters of torus $T$.
-> weights, denote $X^*(T)=\Lambda$. 

Embed $\Lambda$ in $V=\mathbf{R}^{r+1}=\mathbf{R}\otimes X^*(T)$ and make it into Euclidean space with usual inner product. 

$T(F)$ acts on $\mathfrak{g}$
