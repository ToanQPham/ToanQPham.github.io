Why studying group extensions?


+) Answer questions regarding $\mathbb{Q}$ by 
translating into questions about its completions:
Hasse-Minkowski.

Field extensions:

+) Cyclotomic extension: $K/F$ where $K$ is splitting field of 
$X^n-1$ over $F$. 
+) Cyclic extensions: finite Galois extension $K/F$ such that $\text{Gal}(K/F)$
is cyclic. 
+) Kummer theory: study abelian extensions containing 
"enough" roots of unity.
+) Local class field theory: study abelian 
extensions of local number fields.
