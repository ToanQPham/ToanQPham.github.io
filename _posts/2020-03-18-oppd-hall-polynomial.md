Today is 19/03/2020 and I will post what I learn from 18/03/2020. 

## Symmetric functions - Hall polynomials

I read chapter II of Macdonald's book Symmetric Functions and 
Hall Polynomials. Here is a brief summary from that chapter, 
talking about Hall polynomials:

* Define *finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module* $M$, which corresponds
uniquely (up to isomorphism) to a partition $\lambda$ 
(called *type* of $M$).
* Define *Hall algebra* which is $\mathbf{Z}$-generated by 
basis $(u_{\lambda})$ indexed by partition with multiplication 
determined by $G_{\mu \nu}^{\lambda}(\mathfrak{o})$,
which counts number of ubmodule $N$ of type $\nu$ and cotype $\mu$ in 
finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module $M$ of type $\lambda$ 
(here we suppose $k$ is finite with 
$|k|=q$ so $M$ has finitely many elements)
* We give a formula for $G_{\mu \nu}^{\lambda}(\mathfrak{o})$
which is a *Hall polynomial* $g_{\mu \nu}^{\lambda}$ evaluated 
at $q$. 

### Finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module

Let $\mathfrak{o}$ discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal 
$\mathfrak{p}$ and residue field $k=\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}$. 
A *finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module* $M$ is a finitely generated 
$\mathfrak{o}$-module such that $\mathfrak{p}^rM=0$ for 
some $r \ge 0$. 

There is a unique correspondence between finite 
$\mathfrak{o}$-module $M$ and a partition $\lambda$ 
(up to isomorphism of $M$): Since $\mathfrak{o}$
is principal ideal domain, $M$ as finitely generated 
$\mathfrak{o}$-module is direct sum of cyclic modules 

$$
M=\bigoplus_{i=1}^r \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^{\lambda_i}
\label{eq1}\tag{1}
$$

Furthermore, if $\mu_i=\text{dim }_k(\mathfrak{p}^{i-1}
M/\mathfrak{p}^i M)$ then $\mu=(\mu_1,\ldots,)$ is 
conjugate of $\lambda$. We call $\lambda$ *type* of $M$.

If $\lambda$ is *type* of $M$ then let $l(M)=|\lambda|=
\sum \lambda_i$ be the *length* of $M$. The length has 
very useful property (which will be used frequently 
in the chapter) is that if $N$ submodule of $M$
then $l(M)=l(N)+l(M/N)$. The *cotype* of $N$ in $M$
is defined to be the *type* of $M/N$.

Finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module $M$ is *cyclic* 
if its type is $(r)$ consisting of single part 
(very natural definition from \ref{eq1}). $M$
is *elementary* (i.e. $\mathfrak{p}M=0$) iff
its type if $(1^r)$.

### Duality 

Let $\pi$ generater of maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}$.
If $m\le n$, multiplication by $\pi^{n-m}$ is 
injective $\mathfrak{o}$-homomorphism from 
$\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^m$ to $\mathfrak{o}/
\mathfrak{p}^n$. Denote $E=\varinjlim \mathfrak{o}/ 
\mathfrak{p}^n$ then $E$ can be viewed a the smallest 
injective $\mathfrak{o}$-module containing $k$ as submodule. 

The *dual* of finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module $M$ is 
denoted $\widehat{M}=\text{Hom}_{\mathfrak{o}}(M,E)$
which is isomorphic to $M$. Since $E$ injective, exact 
sequence 

$$
\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & N \ar[r] & M \ar[r] & M/N \ar[r] & 0}
$$

gives rise to exact sequence 

$$
\xymatrix{0 & \widehat{N} \ar[l] & \widehat{M} \ar[l] & 
\widehat{M/N} \ar[l] & 0 \ar[l]}
$$

where $\widehat{M/N}$ is the annihilator $N^0$ of $N$ in 
$\widehat{M}$, i.e. set of all $f\in \widehat{M}$
so $f(N)=0$. The natural mapping $M\to \widehat{\widehat{M}}$
is isomorphism for all finite $\mathfrak{o}$-module, 
and identifies $N$ with $N^{00}$. Hence, 

> $N \leftrightarrow N^0$ is a one-one correspondence between 
> submodules of $M, M\widehat{M}$, respectively, which maps 
> set of all $N\subset M$ of type $\nu$ and cotype $\mu$ onto 
> set of all $N^0\subset \widehat{M}$ of type $\mu$ and cotype $\nu$. 

### Hall algebra

We assume $k$ to be finite. Then $M$ 
has finite number of elements. 

Here we define Hall algebra based on structure constants 
$G_{\mu \nu}^{\lambda} (\mathfrak{o})$ which counts number 
of submodule $N$ of type $\nu$ and cotype $\mu$ in finite 
$\mathfrak{o}$-module $M$ of type $\lambda$: 

Let $H=H(\mathfrak{o})$ be 
free $\mathbf{Z}$-module on basis $(u_{\lambda})$ indexed 
by partitions $\lambda$. Define product in $H$ by the rule 

$$
u_{\mu}u_{\nu}=\sum_{\lambda} G_{\mu \nu}^{\lambda}(\mathfrak{o})
u_{\lambda}
$$

Since $l(M)=l(M/N)+l(N)$ so $G_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda}(\mathfrak{o})=0$
unless $|\lambda|=|\mu|+|\nu|$. Hence, the sum in the above 
right-hand side is finite. 

One can show the following 
* $H(\mathfrak{o})$ is commutative and associative ring with 
identity element, which is called *Hall algebra* of $\mathfrak{o}$.
* Ring $H(\mathfrak{o})$ is generated (as $\mathbf{Z}$-algebra)
by elements $u_{(1^r)}$ for $r\ge 1$ and they are algebraically 
independent over $\mathbf{Z}$. This follows that 
Hall algebra $H(\mathfrak{o})$ isomorphic to ring $\Lambda$
of symmetric functions.
