Today is 20/03/2020 and I decided to learn some basics about 
affine varieties, following [Gathmann's note](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2019/alggeom-2019.pdf) mainly. 

The current goal is learn enough 
algebraic geometry to learn about (linear) algebraic groups. 

## Affine varieties

Convention: $K$ is algebraic closed field. (Algebraic 
geometry can be done over arbitrary fields or over rings 
but instead of varieties, the best language to use 
if that of scheme theory). 

By *affine $n$-space* over field $K$, we mean simply
the vector space $K^n$, which is usually denoted as 
$\mathbb{A}_K^n$ or just $\mathbb{A}^n$ (i.e. writing 
this means we ignore the addition and scalar multiplication 
that occur in $K^n$). Given subset $S\subset K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$
of polynomials we call set of common roots in $\mathbb{A}^n$ of 
$S$ the (affine) *zero locus* of $S$, denoted as $V(S)=\{x\in 
\mathbb{A}^n: f(x)=0 \; \forall x\in S\}$. 
An *affine variety* $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$
is the zero locus $V(S)$ of collection 
$S\subset K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$.

Instead of viewing *affine variety* $X$ as zero locus of 
collection $S$ of polynomials, $X$ can be viewed as 
zero locus of ideal $\langle S\rangle$ of 
$K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ since $V(S)=V(\langle S\rangle)$. 
Furthermore, as any ideal in $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$
is finitely generated by Hilbert basis theorem, this means 
that any affine variety can be written as zero locus 
of finitely many polynomials. 

Conversely, for each subset $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$, 
the collection $I(X)$ of all polynomials vanishing on $X$
is an ideal of $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$. We have the 
inclusions $X \subset V(I(X))$ and $J\subset I(V(J))$ 
for $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ and ideal $J\subset 
K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$. The question is whether these 
are equal or not, which is the content of 
following theorem.
