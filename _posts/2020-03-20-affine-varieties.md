Today is 20/03/2020 and I decided to learn some basics about 
affine varieties, following [Gathmann's note](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2019/alggeom-2019.pdf) mainly. 

The current goal is learn enough 
algebraic geometry to learn about (linear) algebraic groups. 

## Affine varieties

Convention: $K$ is algebraic closed field. (Algebraic 
geometry can be done over arbitrary fields or over rings 
but instead of varieties, the best language to use 
if that of scheme theory). 

By *affine $n$-space* over field $K$, we mean simply
the vector space $K^n$, which is usually denoted as 
$\mathbb{A}_K^n$ or just $\mathbb{A}^n$ (i.e. writing 
this means we ignore the addition and scalar multiplication 
that occur in $K^n$). Given subset $S\subset K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$
of polynomials we call set of common roots in $\mathbb{A}^n$ of 
$S$ the (affine) *zero locus* of $S$, denoted as $V(S)=\{x\in 
\mathbb{A}^n: f(x)=0 \; \forall x\in S\}$. 
An *affine variety* $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$
is the zero locus $V(S)$ of collection 
$S\subset K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$.

Instead of viewing *affine variety* $X$ as zero locus of 
collection $S$ of polynomials, $X$ can be viewed as 
zero locus of ideal $\langle S\rangle$ of 
$K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ since $V(S)=V(\langle S\rangle)$. 
Furthermore, as any ideal in $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$
is finitely generated by Hilbert basis theorem, this means 
that any affine variety can be written as zero locus 
of finitely many polynomials. 

Conversely, for each subset $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$, 
the collection of all polynomials vanishing on $X$
is an ideal of $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, denoted as $I(X)$. 
We have the inclusions $X \subset V(I(X))$ and $J\subset I(V(J))$ 
for $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ and ideal $J\subset 
K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$. A question is that whether 
these are actually equal or not. 

It is not always true that $J=I(V(J))$. A quick 
way to see $I(V(J))\ne J$ is notice that if we work 
with $K[x_1]$ (i.e. $n=1$) then with $f(x_1)=(x_1-a)^k$
then $V(f)=\{a\}$, which does not contain the data 
about multiplicity $k$, so when we apply $I(\dot)$ to
$V(f)$ we obtain $I(V(f))=\langle (x_1-a)\rangle$,
which is not $J=\langle (x_1-a)^k\rangle$ if $k>1$. 
This example suggests us to define the *radical* 
$\sqrt{J}$ of ideal $J$ of ring $R$ to be 

$$
\sqrt{J}=\{f\in R: f^k \in J \; \text{for some }
k\in \mathbb{N}\}
$$

In fact, $I(V(J))=\sqrt{J}$, as shown by following 
theorem 

> (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz) For any affine variety 
> $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ we have $V(I(X))=X$. For any 
> ideal $J$ of $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, we have $I(V(J))=
> \sqrt{J}$. In particular, there is an inclusion reversing 
> bijection 
> $$\begin{align*} 
> \\{ \text{affine varieties in } \mathbb{A}^n \\}
> & \leftrightarrow \\{ \text{radical ideal in } 
> K[x_1,\ldots, x_n] \\}
> \end{align*}$$
