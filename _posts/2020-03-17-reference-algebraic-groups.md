For purpose OPPD, just want to give some links to reference about
(linear) algebraic groups I found online so that I don't have to 
look those up again. 

We have classial recommended textbooks about linear algebraic groups: Borel, Springer, 
Humphreys, ... , [Milne's book](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/iAG200.pdf) (also see [this Milne's note 1](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/RG.pdf)
for summary
and [note 2](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LAG.pdf))

Notes online about algebraic geometry:
* Gathman: https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2019/alggeom-2019.pdf

Notes online about linear algebraic groups:
* https://www.math.toronto.edu/~herzig/lin-alg-groups13.pdf
* http://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~conrad/252Page/handouts/alggroups.pdf
* https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/fbouyer/algebraic_groups_study_group.pdf
* https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~ploog/WS2014/lag.pdf
* http://pagine.dm.unipi.it/tamas/lag.pdf

Since I will learn the Lie algebra part of it first so these references is for later.
