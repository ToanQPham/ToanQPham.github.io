I think the idea is that lots of representations of reductive groups (in this case I think SL2) can be realized as representations in spaces of functions satisfying some convenient equation, and Whittaker functions happen to be in these spaces.

There is some functional equation involved with spherical harmonics etc in Jacquet's 1967 paper, so I believe the so-called Whittaker model arises from the rep theory of SO(2, R). 
On the other hand, q-deformed Whittaker functions (showing up as solutions to quantum D-modules over flag varieties) have another physical interpretation as eigenfunctions of the quantum Toda lattice, being related to the rep theory of quantum Yang-Baxter.
