<p>
Simplicial homology means the study of homology of simplicial complexes. First, we define simplicial complexes. 
<p>
 
 <div style= " background: #ffffff; border-left: 5px solid ; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding-left: 10px; "><b>Definition 1.</b> <em> An \vocab{(abstract) simplicial complex} consists of a set ${V}$, i.e. set of <i>vertices</i>, together with a set ${S}$ of subsets of ${V}$ such that 

<ol> <li> ${\{v\}}$ in ${S}$ for every ${v\in V}$. <li> If ${\sigma \in S}$ and ${\emptyset \ne \tau \subset \sigma \in S}$ then ${\tau \in S}$, i.e. ${S}$ is closed under operation of taking nonempty subsets. 
</ol>

 Elements of ${S}$ are called \vocab{simplices}. If ${\sigma=\{v_0,\ldots, v_n\}\in S}$ then ${\sigma}$ is \vocab{${n}$-simplex} and ${n\ge 0}$ is the \vocab{dimension} of ${\sigma}$. The dimension of the simplicial complex is the largest dimension of a simplex in ${K}$. Vertices (i.e. elements of ${V}$) are identified with ${0}$-simplices. Denote ${K^r}$ as set of all ${r}$-simplices in ${K}$.
<p>
 For a ${n}$-simplex ${\sigma}$, any ${\emptyset \ne \tau \subset \sigma}$ of dimension ${r}$ is called a \vocab{${r}$-face} of ${\sigma}$. The union of all ${(n-1)}$-faces is called the \vocab{boundary} of the simplex.

The goal of homology is to count number of "holes" of some geometric objects, such as torus, Klein bottle, or graph, ... In simplicial context, a "hole" is a combination of simplices which could possibly be the boundary of a simplex or of a combination of simplices, but is not. For example, the ${2}$-simplex has a boundary (according to definition) which is the set of its three edges. However, the set of three edges of a simplicial circle is not a boundary, and geometrically, it forms a "hole".

Another example is the simplicial torus which has three uppermost edges looking just like the boundary of a ${2}$-simplex but there is no ${2}$-simplex in this simplicial torus. That's how we realize there's a hole in the torus.

To define homology groups, we need an orientation for our complex.
<p>

 <div style= " background: #ffffff; border-left: 5px solid; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding-left: 10px; "><b>Definition 3 (Orientation).</b> <em> <a name="SimplicialComplex_def1orientation"></a> An \vocab{orientation} of a simplex is an ordering of vertices of that simplex. An orientation of a simplicial complex is a choice of orientation of each simplex. If ${\{v_0,\ldots,v_k\}}$ spans ${k}$-simplex ${\sigma}$ then we will use the symbol ${[v_0,\ldots, v_k]}$ to denote the oriented simplex. 
<p>
 There are many ways to define an orientation of a simplicial complex ${K=(V,S)}$. For example, one can define a total ordering on the vertex set ${V}$ and induce an ordering for each simplex whose vertex set is a subset of ${V}$. In particular, if our ordered vertex set is ${V=\{v_0,\ldots, v_n\}}$ then ${[v_{a_0},\ldots,v_{a_k}]}$ is an oriented simplex iff ${a_i&lt;a_j}$ for any ${i&lt;j}$. Simplcial complex with this orientation is called \vocab{ordered} simplicial complex. This will be our choice for the definition of orientation. 
<p>
 One can also define a partial ordering on ${V}$ that induces a total ordering on each simplex of ${K}$. 
<p>
 Another way is that we define the orientation of an ${n}$-simplex ${[v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_n]}$ to be an equivalence class of orderings of the vertices where two orderings are equivalence if and only if one can be obtained from the other by an even permutation. For example, ${[v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3]=[v_1,v_0,v_3,v_2]= -[v_0,v_2,v_1,v_3]}$. \footnote{Most books/notes use the last definition for orientation but by doing this, one would have to prove well-defineness (since we are dealing will equivalence classes) for any other definitions using the orientation.}

<p>
 At the moment, \textcolor{red}{any?} choice of orientation helps to define homology but soon we will see that if we have a simplicial complex that has \textcolor{red}{realization?} as some \textcolor{red}{topological space?} (and we want our homology of the complex to be applicable to the \textcolor{red}{realization}) then we need some restrictions for our choice of orientation (in order to make such \textcolor{red}{realization} possible).

The <i>only</i> purpose in defining the orientation of simplices is to define the boundary of a chain (or more specifically, to define the face maps).
