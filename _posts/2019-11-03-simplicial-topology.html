<p align=center><b> &mdash;  1. Simplicial homology  &mdash; </b></p>


<p>
Simplicial homology means the study of homology of simplicial complexes. First, we define simplicial complexes. 
<p>
 
 <div style= " background: #ffffff; border-left: 5px solid grey; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding-left: 10px; font-size:13px "><b>Definition 1.</b>  An <var>(abstract) simplicial complex</var> consists of a set ${V}$, i.e. set of <i>vertices</i>, together with a set ${S}$ of subsets of ${V}$ such that 

<ol> <li> ${\{v\}}$ in ${S}$ for every ${v\in V}$. <li> If ${\sigma \in S}$ and ${\emptyset \ne \tau \subset \sigma \in S}$ then ${\tau \in S}$, i.e. ${S}$ is closed under operation of taking nonempty subsets. 
</ol>

 Elements of ${S}$ are called <var>simplices</var>. If ${\sigma=\{v_0,\ldots, v_n\}\in S}$ then ${\sigma}$ is <var>${n}$-simplex</var> and ${n\ge 0}$ is the <var>dimension</var> of ${\sigma}$. The dimension of the simplicial complex is the largest dimension of a simplex in ${K}$. Vertices (i.e. elements of ${V}$) are identified with ${0}$-simplices. Denote ${K^r}$ as set of all ${r}$-simplices in ${K}$.
<p>
 For a ${n}$-simplex ${\sigma}$, any ${\emptyset \ne \tau \subset \sigma}$ of dimension ${r}$ is called a <var>${r}$-face</var> of ${\sigma}$. The union of all ${(n-1)}$-faces is called the <var>boundary</var> of the simplex.

The goal of homology is to count number of "holes" of some geometric objects, such as torus, Klein bottle, or graph, ... In simplicial context, a "hole" is a combination of simplices which could possibly be the boundary of a simplex or of a combination of simplices, but is not. For example, the ${2}$-simplex has a boundary (according to definition) which is the set of its three edges. However, the set of three edges of a simplicial circle is not a boundary, and geometrically, it forms a "hole".

Another example is the simplicial torus which has three uppermost edges looking just like the boundary of a ${2}$-simplex but there is no ${2}$-simplex in this simplicial torus. That's how we realize there's a hole in the torus.

To define homology groups, we need an orientation for our complex.
<p>

 <div style= " background: #ffffff; border-left: 5px solid grey; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding-left: 10px; font-size:13px "><b>Definition 3 (Orientation).</b>  <a name="SimplicialComplex_def1orientation"></a> An <var>orientation</var> of a simplex is an ordering of vertices of that simplex. An orientation of a simplicial complex is a choice of orientation of each simplex. If ${\{v_0,\ldots,v_k\}}$ spans ${k}$-simplex ${\sigma}$ then we will use the symbol ${[v_0,\ldots, v_k]}$ to denote the oriented simplex. 
<p>
 There are many ways to define an orientation of a simplicial complex ${K=(V,S)}$. For example, one can define a total ordering on the vertex set ${V}$ and induce an ordering for each simplex whose vertex set is a subset of ${V}$. In particular, if our ordered vertex set is ${V=\{v_0,\ldots, v_n\}}$ then ${[v_{a_0},\ldots,v_{a_k}]}$ is an oriented simplex iff ${a_i&lt;a_j}$ for any ${i&lt;j}$. Simplcial complex with this orientation is called <var>ordered</var> simplicial complex. This will be our choice for the definition of orientation. 
<p>
 One can also define a partial ordering on ${V}$ that induces a total ordering on each simplex of ${K}$. 
<p>
 Another way is that we define the orientation of an ${n}$-simplex ${[v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_n]}$ to be an equivalence class of orderings of the vertices where two orderings are equivalence if and only if one can be obtained from the other by an even permutation. For example, ${[v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3]=[v_1,v_0,v_3,v_2]= -[v_0,v_2,v_1,v_3]}$. \footnote{Most books/notes use the last definition for orientation but by doing this, one would have to prove well-defineness (since we are dealing will equivalence classes) for any other definitions using the orientation.}

<p>
 At the moment, \textcolor{red}{any?} choice of orientation helps to define homology but soon we will see that if we have a simplicial complex that has \textcolor{red}{realization?} as some \textcolor{red}{topological space?} (and we want our homology of the complex to be applicable to the \textcolor{red}{realization}) then we need some restrictions for our choice of orientation (in order to make such \textcolor{red}{realization} possible).

<p>
The <i>only</i> purpose in defining the orientation of simplices is to define the boundary of a chain (or more specifically, to define the face maps).

In particular, ${C_r(K)}$ is a free abelian group generated by ${r}$-simplices.

The boundary of an ${(r+1)}$-simplex, which is a set of ${r+1}$ ${r}$-simplices, which can be represented as an ${r}$-chain through the boundary homomorphism, is in the image of the boundary homomorphism ${\partial_{r+1}}$. This suggests the name for elements of ${\text{im}\partial_{r+1}}$ as <var>${r}$-boundaries</var>. As ${\text{im} \partial_{r+1} \subset \ker \partial_r}$, ${\ker \partial_r}$ is the set of ${r}$-chains that <i>could potentially be</i> boundary and we call elements of ${\ker \partial_r}$ as <var>${r}$-cycles</var>. Recall that in homology, we would like to know which combination of simplices that could be a boundary but is not, i.e. ${r}$-chains in ${\ker \partial_{n}}$ that is not in ${\partial_{n+1}}$. Hence, one way to do this is take the quotient group ${\ker \partial_r/\text{im} \partial_{r+1}}$, which will be the definition of homology group:

The equivalence class of a ${r}$-cycle ${\alpha}$ is the <var>homology class</var> ${[\alpha]}$.

<p align=center><b> &mdash;  1.1. Q: Does simplicial homology depends on orientation?  &mdash; </b></p>

 If our chosen definition of orientation based on a total ordering of the vertices then the answer is no. <a href="problem">\href</a>{MSE}} Let ${K}$ be a simplicial complex and denote ${K_1}$ and ${K_2}$ the complexes obtained from ${K}$ with two different orientations then the simplicial homology groups of ${K_1}$ and ${K_2}$ are isomorphic. That is, for each ${n}$, we have ${H_n(K_1) \cong H_n(K_2)}$.

Perhaps this question is answered in \cite{Barr_OrientedSingularHomology}.
<p>
 Oriented simplicial complex and ordered simplicial complex, what's the difference?
