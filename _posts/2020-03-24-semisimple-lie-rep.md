On 22/03/2020, I managed to understand the argument in Bushnell Henniart book. 
But the amount I managed to read from that book is very little. 

On 23/03/2020, I learnt about classification of complex semisimple Lie 
algebras and its representations. I will definitely write this here. 

I spent most of my time during these two days doing university work, 
which is quite ineffective.
