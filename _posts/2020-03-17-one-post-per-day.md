Today is 17/03/2020. 

Since I have gone too lazy these days without learning not as much mathematics
each day, I decide to try to make one post per day (or may be per two days 
if busy) telling about what I learned. It won't be like many mathematicians'blogs
you find online but rather just like a normal blog/diary. 

# What do I currently want to learn?

Following the flow of mathematics community at my university, 
below are things I want to learn first:

1. **(Linear) algebraic groups / Lie algebras and representations.** 
Right know, I think this is the most important thing I need to 
learn first (as you will see next items in the list all related 
to this). Here is what I plane to prioritise first:
    1. First, I want to learn classification of representations 
of semisimple Lie algebras. 
    2. Next will be learn structure theory of reductive groups (?), 
but since this require some algebraic geometry, I may need to 
learn those first. This serves as the prereq for the 3rd item 
in this list.  

2. **Symmetric functions and related areas.** I am currently following 
Macdonald's book and see how far I go first. I also need to write 
a report about this so this _One post per day_ might be useful 
motivating me to write the report. 

3. **Representation of (reductive?) p-adic groups** Something 
along those lines. For now I am following Bushnell and Henniart 
Local Langlands for GL(2) with very slow reading speed. But I 
realized many other notes follow have some parts (say Parabolic induction, 
Jacquet functor) in generality for general reductive $p$-adic groups(?)
instead of $GL_2(F)$ so I am hesitating what to choose to get the 
best out of it. That is the first item in this list is very 
important right now. 

4. **Crystal bases.** We have a reading course about this in our university. 
So there are two books: Hong and Kang, the other by Bump and Schilling. 
We follow Bump and Schilling in our reading course, focusing mostly 
on the combinatorics part of it. In this blog I will see how much 
I learn from these two books and post this here. I also need to present 
some material from one of these books. 

5. **Cluster algebras.** See [Gregg Musiker's website](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~musiker/)
for a lot of references. Right now I plan to follow Sergey Fomin, Laurent Williams, and 
Andrei Zelevinsky, Introduction to Cluster Algebras. 

# Why posting in blogs will help learning these?

I need some audiences (imaginary audiences also fine) to listen to me 
talking about this.
