 The main idea in this chapter is that the count for number of walks of length ${\ell}$ in a graph can be done by finding the entries of certain matrix or equivalently, finding the eigenvalues of such matrix. Conversely, one can even find the eigenvalues of such matrix by counting number of closed walks of lenght ${\ell}$ in a graph corresponding to such matrix:
<p>
The \vocab{adjacency matrix} of graph ${G}$ is ${p\times p}$ matrix ${\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}(G)}$, over the field of complex numbers, whose ${(i,j)}$-entry ${a_{i,j}}$ is equal to number of edges incident to ${v_i}$ and ${v_j}$. Thus ${\mathbf{A}}$ is a real symmetric matrix (so real eigenvalues) whose trace is the number of loops in ${G}$. 
<p>
This chapter shows that for any integer ${\ell\ge 1}$, the ${(i,j)}$-entry of the matrix ${\mathbf{A}(G)^{\ell}}$ is equal to the number of walks from ${v_i}$ to ${v_j}$ in ${G}$ of length ${\ell}$. Furthermore, due to the fact that ${\mathbf{A}(G)}$ is real symmetric means there exists orthogonal matrix ${U}$ such that ${U^{-1}\mathcal{A}^{\ell}U}$ is a diagonal matrix. This implies that if ${\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_p}$ are eigenvalues of ${\mathbf{A}(G)}$ then there exists real numbers ${c_1,\ldots, c_p}$ such that for all ${\ell\ge 1}$ then <p align=center>$\displaystyle  (\mathbf{A}(G)^{\ell})_{i,j}=c_1\lambda_1^{\ell} +c_2\lambda_2^{\ell}+\ldots+c_p\lambda_p^{\ell}.$</p>
 In a particular case where we want to count number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ (from any vertex), this is then equal to <p align=center>$\displaystyle f_G(\ell)=\sum_{i=1}^p (\mathbf{A}(G)^{\ell})_{i,i}=\text{trace}(\mathbf{A}(G)^{\ell}) =\lambda_1^{\ell}+\ldots+\lambda_p^{\ell}.$</p>
 An amazing fact is that if we know formula for ${f_G(\ell)}$ for all ${\ell}$ then we can determine eigenvalues of ${\mathbf{A}}$. In particular, if we can show ${f_G(\ell)=\alpha_1^{\ell}+\ldots+\alpha_p^{\ell}}$ for all ${\ell\ge1 }$ then ${\alpha_i}$'s are eigenvalues of ${\mathbf{A}}$.

<ol> <li> As mentioned in Corollary 1.6, it suffices to count number of sequences ${(i_1,\ldots, i_{\ell})}$ of numbers ${1,2,\ldots, p}$ such that ${i_1=i}$, no two consecutive terms are equal, and ${i_{\ell}\ne i_1}$.
<p>
Let such answer be ${f_{\ell}}$. If the last condition is not true, i.e. if ${i_{\ell}=i_1}$, then ${i_{\ell-1}\ne i_1}$ and number of such sequences is exactly ${f_{\ell-1}}$. 
<p>
We count number of such sequences so that the last condition ${i_{\ell}\ne i_1}$ is neglected. There are ${p-1}$ choices for ${i_2}$, ${p-1}$ choices for ${i_3}$ and keep going until there are ${p-1}$ choices for ${i_{\ell}}$. Hence, number of such sequences so that it doesn't matter whether ${i_{\ell}}$ is equal to ${i_1}$ or not is ${(p-1)^{\ell-1}}$. This is precisely ${f_{\ell}+f_{\ell-1}}$. Hence, ${f_{\ell}+f_{\ell-1}=(p-1)^{\ell-1}}$.
<p>
Note that ${f_1=0}$ (since we know ${f_2=p-1}$ and we want ${f_2+f_1=p-1}$). This follows <p align=center>$\displaystyle  \begin{aligned}  f_{\ell} & = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell-1} (-1)^{i+1}(f_{\ell-i+1}-f_{\ell-i}), \\ & = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell-1} (-1)^{i+1} (p-1)^{\ell-i}, \\ p \cdot f_{\ell}& = (p-1+1) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{\ell-1} (-1)^{i+1} (p-1)^{\ell-i} \right), \\ p \cdot f_{\ell} & = (p-1)^{\ell}+(-1)^{\ell}(p-1). \end{aligned} $</p>

<p>
<li> From the condition and similarly to \cite[Example 1.8]{algcomb_stanley}, we know the eigenvalues of ${\textbf{A}(G)}$ is ${8,3,3,-1,-1,-1,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0}$. If we add a loop at each vertex of ${G}$ to get ${G'}$ then ${\textbf{A}(G')=\textbf{A}(G)+I}$, which means eigenvalues of ${G'}$ are ${9,4,4,0,0,0,7,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1}$. Hence, number of closed walks in ${G'}$ of length ${\ell}$ is ${f_{G'}(\ell)=9^{\ell}+2\cdot 4^{\ell}+7^{\ell}+5\cdot 2^{\ell}+3}$.
<p>
<li> For bipartite graph ${G}$, there are no closed walks in ${G}$ of odd length ${\ell}$ so ${f_G(\ell)=0}$ for all odd ${\ell}$. From corollary 1.6, we know ${f_G(\ell)=\lambda_1^{\ell}+\cdots +\lambda_p^{\ell}}$. If nonzero eigenvalues of ${G}$ don't come in pairs ${\pm \lambda}$ then let ${\lambda= \max \{|\lambda_i|:1\le i \le p\}}$, one can show that ${\left|\sum_{|\lambda_i|=\lambda} \lambda_i^{\ell}\right| &gt;\left| \sum_{|\lambda_i|&lt;\lambda} \lambda_i^{\ell}\right|}$ for sufficiently large ${\ell}$, which means ${f_G(\ell)}$ is nonzero for sufficiently large ${\ell}$, a contradiction. We are done. 
<p>
<li> (a) As discussed in previous exercise, for odd ${\ell}$ then ${f_{K_{rs}}(\ell)=0}$. If ${\ell}$ is even, for a closed walks of length ${\ell}$, one needs to go from ${u_i}$ to ${v_j}$ exactly ${\ell/2}$ times and from ${v_j}$ to ${u_i}$ also ${\ell/2}$ times. However, the last edge must return to the starting vertex so if there are ${r^{\ell/2}s^{\ell/2-1}}$ closed walks that starts at some ${v_j}$ and ${r^{\ell/2-1}s^{\ell/2}}$ closed walks that starts at some ${u_i}$. This follows the total number of closed walks for even ${\ell}$ is ${f_{K_{rs}}(\ell)=2(rs)^{\ell/2}}$. 
<p>
(b) From previous exercise, part (a) and following \cite[Example 1.8]{algcomb_stanley}, the eigenvalues of ${K_{rs}}$ are ${\pm\sqrt{rs}}$ and ${0}$ with multiplicity ${r+s-2}$. 
<p>
<li> It suffices to find number of closed walks in ${H_n}$. Let ${g_{\ell}}$ be number of closed walks in ${H_n}$ from some vertex ${u}$. Since ${H_n}$ is bipartite graph so ${g_{\ell}=0}$ for odd ${\ell}$. We will find ${g_{\ell}}$ for even ${\ell}$:
<p>
Suppose that ${w}$ is not adjacent to vertex ${u}$ in ${G}$. This means for any closed walk ${uv_{1} \cdots v_{\ell-1}u}$ of length ${\ell}$ from ${u}$, the second-to-last vertex ${v_{\ell-1}}$ must be different from ${w}$. Hence, <p align=center>$\displaystyle  \begin{aligned}  g_{\ell} &=\# (\text{closed walks length }\ell\text{ from }u), \\ &= \# (\text{walks length }\ell-1 \text{ from } u \text{ to vertex different from }w)\\ &= \# (\text{walks length }\ell-1 \text{ from }u) \\ &\quad - \# (\text{walks length }\ell-1 \text{ from }u \text{ to }w), \\ &= (n-1)^{\ell-1}- \# (\text{walks length }\ell-1 \text{ from }u \text{ to }w), \\ &= (n-1)^{\ell-1}- \left[ \# (\text{walks length }\ell-2 \text{ from }u)\right. \\ &\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \left. - \text{closed walks length }\ell-2 \text{ from }u)\right], \\ & = (n-1)^{\ell-1}-\left[ (n-1)^{\ell-2}-g_{\ell-2}\right]. \end{aligned} $</p>
 Note ${g_0=1}$ so from this recursive relation, we find ${g_{\ell}= \frac{(n-1)^{\ell}+n-1}{n}}$. By the symmetry of the graph ${H_n}$, as there are ${2n}$ vertices in ${H_{2n}}$, the total number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ in ${H_n}$ is ${2n \cdot g_{\ell}= 2(n-1)^{\ell}+2(n-1)}$ for even ${\ell}$. This follows for all ${\ell \ge 1}$, we have <p align=center>$\displaystyle f_{H_n}(\ell)=(n-1)^{\ell}+(1-n)^{\ell}+(n-1) \cdot 1^{\ell} +(n-1) \cdot (-1)^{\ell}.$</p>
 Thus, the eigenvalues of ${H_n}$ are ${\pm 1}$ (${n-1}$ times each) and ${\pm (n-1)}$ (once each) according to Corollary 1.3 and Lemma 1.7. 
<p>
<li> (a) Imagine each vertex set ${V_i}$ as a big vertex then ${K(n,p)}$ can be seen as a complete graph of ${p}$ vertices ${V_i}$'s. Hence, to count number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ in ${K(n,p)}$ starting from ${v_1\in V_1}$, we first choose a closed walks of length ${\ell}$ of ${p}$ vertices ${V_i}$'s of ${K_p}$ starting from ${V_1}$. From corollary 1.6, there are ${(\textbf{A}(K_p)^{\ell})_{1,1}}$ such closed walks. 
<p>
For each such closed walk ${V_1 V_{k_1} \cdots V_{k_{\ell-1}}V_1}$, there are ${n}$ ways to go from ${v_1\in V}$ to a vertex ${v_{k_1}}$ in ${V_{k_1}}$, ${n}$ ways to go from ${v_{k_1}}$ to ${v_{k_2} \in V_{k_2}}$ and keep going until ${V_{k_{\ell-1}}}$. Note there is one way to go from a vertex in ${V_{k_{\ell-1}}}$ back to ${v_1 \in V_1}$ to form a closed walk. Hence, there are ${n^{\ell}-1}$ closed walks that follow ${V_1 V_{k_1}\cdots V_{k_{\ell-1}}V_1}$. 
<p>
Thus, number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ in ${K(n,p)}$ starting from a specific vertex is <p align=center>$\displaystyle  (\textbf{A}(K_p)^{\ell})_{i,i} \cdot n^{\ell-1}= \frac{n^{\ell-1}}{p}\left( (p-1)^{\ell}+(p-1)(-1)^{\ell}\right).$</p>
 Due to the symmetry of ${K(n,p)}$, the total number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ in ${K(n,p)}$ is <p align=center>$\displaystyle  n^{\ell}\left( (p-1)^{\ell}+(p-1)(-1)^{\ell}\right).$</p>
 From this, \cite[Corollary 1.3]{algcomb_stanley} and \cite[Lemma 1.7]{algcomb_stanley}, we find that eigenvalues of ${K(n,p)}$ are ${-n}$ of mulitplicity ${p-1}$, ${n(p-1)}$ of multiplicity ${1}$ and ${0}$ of multiplicity ${p(n-1)}$.
<p>
<li> The same method as in previous exercise. Using \cite[Corollary 1.3]{algcomb_stanley}, we find the total number of closed walks length ${\ell}$ in ${G(n)}$ is ${n^{\ell}\sum_{i=1}^{p}\lambda_i^{\ell}}$. Thus, the eigenvalues of ${G(n)}$ are ${\lambda_in}$ (each with multiplicity ${1}$) and ${0}$ with multiplicity ${p(n-1)}$.
<p>
<li> We can easily find that ${\textbf{A}(G')=\begin{pmatrix} \textbf{A}(G) & I \\ I & O \end{pmatrix}}$ where ${I}$ is ${p\times p}$ identity matrix and ${O}$ is ${p\times p}$ all-zero matrix. Let ${\begin{pmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{pmatrix}}$ be an eigenvector of ${\textbf{A}(G')}$ with respect to eigenvalue ${\lambda'}$. Here ${V_1,V_2}$ are ${p\times 1}$ matrices and ${V_1}$ is eigenvector of ${\textbf{A}(G)}$ with respect to eigenvalue ${\lambda}$. We have <p align=center>$\displaystyle \lambda'\begin{pmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} \textbf{A}(G) & I \\ I & O \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda V_1+V_2 \\ V_1 \end{pmatrix}$</p>
 Solving this gives ${(\lambda')^2-\lambda\lambda'-1=0}$ or ${\lambda'= \frac{\lambda\pm \sqrt{\lambda^2+4}}{2}}$, as desired. 
<p>
<li> (a) From \cite[Corollary 1.2]{algcomb_stanley}, we know ${c_k(i,j)=u_{ik}u_{jk}}$ where ${U=(u_{ij})}$ is a real orthonormal matrix so ${U^{-1}AU=\text{diag}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots, \lambda_p)}$. Hence, ${c_k(i,i)=u_{ik}^2\ge 0}$.
<p>
(b) it suffices to choose a symmetric matrix of positive integer entries such that one of its orthonormal vectors has both positive and negative entries. We can choose ${G}$ such that ${\textbf{A}(G)=\begin{pmatrix} a & b\\ b & a\end{pmatrix}}$ where ${a\ne b}$. With this, ${\begin{pmatrix} \pm 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}}$ are orthonormal vectors of this matrix.
<p>
<li> Essentially ${G^*=G^2}$ so eigenvalues of ${G^*}$ are ${\lambda_i^2}$'s.
<p>
<li> We can write the adjacency matrix of ${\Gamma= K_n^o-K_m^o}$ as ${\begin{pmatrix} O_{m\times m} & I_{m\times (n-m)} \\ I_{(n-m)\times m} & I_{(n-m)\times (n-m)} \end{pmatrix}}$. Essentially we go and find the eigenvalues of ${\Gamma}$ using linear algebra and the rest one applies \cite[Corollary 1.3]{algcomb_stanley}. 
<p>
<li> (a) Number of closed walks of length ${\ell}$ in ${G}$ is obviously less than or equal to total of number of walks of length ${\ell}$ starting at each vertex. The latter is at most ${p\Delta^2}$ so we obtain ${f_G(\ell)=\lambda_1^{\ell} +\ldots+\lambda_p^{\ell} \le p\Delta^{\ell}}$ for any positive integer ${\ell}$. This implies ${\lambda_1\le \Delta}$.
<p>
(b) If ${G}$ is simple then ${f_G(1)=0}$ and ${f_G(2)=2q}$. This follows ${\lambda_1+\ldots+\lambda_p=0}$ and ${\lambda_1^2+\ldots+\lambda_p^2=2q}$. We have <p align=center>$\displaystyle \lambda_2^2+\ldots+\lambda_p^2 \ge \frac{1}{p-1}(\lambda_2+\ldots+\lambda_p)^2 =\frac{1}{p-1}\lambda_1^2.$</p>
 Therefore, <p align=center>$\displaystyle  2q \ge \lambda_1^2 \cdot \frac{p}{p-1} \implies \lambda_1 \le \sqrt{2q}.$</p>
