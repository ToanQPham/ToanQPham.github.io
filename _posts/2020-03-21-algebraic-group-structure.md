On 21/03/2020, I had a quick read through structure theory of linear algebraic groups
so that I know certain terminologies, how they are defined. 

I learn these from [Fiona Murnaghan's short note](http://www.math.toronto.edu/murnaghan/courses/algp.pdf)
about linear algebraic groups and [Daniel Bump's note](http://sporadic.stanford.edu/bump/math263/hecke.pdf),
starting from section 4. 

Also, I am stuck at a certain argument when reading Bushnell, Henniart's book 
Local Langlands for GL(2) and spend some time with it but with no 
progress. 

I will try to write something if I have time.
