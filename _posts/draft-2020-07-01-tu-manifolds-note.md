Here are some notes/questions on Tu's Introduction to Manifolds book:

When $(0,0)$ is identified with $(1,0)$, why the tangent vector $e_1,e_2$
at $(0,0)$ mapsto tangent vector $e_1,-e_2$ at $(0,1)$? 

I would understand $e_1$ at $p=(0,0)$ to be identified with 
$\partial/\partial_x|_{(0,0)}$.

Maybe a more general question. How do we identify tangent space for 
$R/\sim$, i.e. a topological space with equivalence relation (assuming 
it has manifold structure, or even what is this manifold structure of 
$R/\sim$?)

I don't know if these references answer my question or not 
when I try look at it: page 71 of the book talk about quotients and 
this [MSE](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1377112/58951).
